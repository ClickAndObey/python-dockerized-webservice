# Testing

## Pytest

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a python testing framework that uses decorators and name scheming to
manage tests. It offers a lot of functionality to enable running swaths of tests with benchmarking capability.

## Pipenv

[Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) is a tool that allows for virtualizing a python environment. It uses a
Pipfile (with accompanying Pipfile.lock) to manage dependencies. This allows users to not require any specific package
installations locally, but instead uses the environment to control the installation.
